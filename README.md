# USB-Duino-Coin-Miner

Duino Coin is a crypto currency that can be mined on low powered devices such as an Arduino Uno.

This project is a USB Duino Coin Miner that required a host computer to run the minning application on. The more USB miners used, the more mining power is available.

In the project you will find KiCAD files for the schematic and PCB layout.
